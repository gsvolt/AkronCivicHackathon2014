The goal of this repo is to archive and collect problem descriptions and deliverables from the event.

## City of Akron Economic Development Department

### Problem:

The ability to accurately track historical project data and project expenditures is a critical function of a planning organization.   Most municipal projects can be classified into a finite number of categories such as transportation, parks, or housing.   During the early phases of a new project, the planning organization is tasked with defining both the both scope, and type, of project to be implemented.   As the project is designed, and then constructed, key information (such as cost, project timeframe, and funding) is documented and stored for future reporting.

The city of Akron is currently pursuing the development of a data collection and reporting system that will allow project data input and project reporting to be completed in a reasonably simple fashion. This program contemplates the use of a database to accurately collect and report this information. Project reporting often needs to answer questions such as:

* What was the project name, scope, and limits?
* When was the project started and completed?
* What were the expenditures, by year, on the project?
* What funding sources(s) were used during the life of the project?

The end product of this initiative will provide a data entry and reporting system that can accurately provide information about city of Akron projects, in a format that addresses the specific question(s) being asked. Once this new information system is complete, our intent is to input data on city of Akron projects dating back to the 1960’s, while also tracking all current and future projects completed by the city of Akron.

#### Solution

Akron Civic Hackathon 2014 will allow City of Akron's Economic Development to gather information from their internal data stores (like Excel files) and submit it to their GIS system from ESRI. This will allow them to select a geographical region on a map and report on how much money was budgeted, forecasted, and finally committed in that region.
